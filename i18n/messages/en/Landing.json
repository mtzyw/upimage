        "answer": "ImgEnhancer is designed to be accessible and user-friendly for creators of all backgrounds and skill levels. It's intuitive interface, in-depth tutorials, and community are all available to support you through your creative journey."

      },
      {
        "question": "Will the upscaled images have artefacts?",
        "answer": "Sometimes, yes. But in most cases, they can be controlled using the Creativity, HDR, and Resemblance sliders, as well as through natural language with your text prompt. Most artifacts occur only when the Creativity or HDR values are set too high, or the Resemblance is not properly configured."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the payment service secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, our payment service is 100% secure. Financial processing is handled by Stripe, and we retain no card details on our end. Stripe upholds security standards comparable to those of banks."

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a refund?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds due to the substantial expenses associated with the AI-driven upscaling process. Our costs are significant, particularly for the GPU processing time required to upscale your images. During sign up you agree to withhold your right to refund for this reason."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I cancel my subscription?",
        "answer": "You can cancel your subscription at any time. Log in, go to the top of ImgEnhancer AI and click Billing, you will be redirected to Stripe's billing portal where you can download invoices, switch plans and cancel your subscription."
